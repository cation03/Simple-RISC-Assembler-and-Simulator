# RISC Assembler and Simulator

## Introduction

This is a RISC assembler and simulator written in Python 3. The assembler converts RISC instructions into binary, while the simulator does the opposite, executing the instructions and keeping track of the state of the system.

### Prerequisites
To use this software, you will need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:

- `matplotlib` for plotting the memory blocks vs number of cycles
